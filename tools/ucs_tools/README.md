# UCS Tools overview

NVIDIAÂ® Unified Cloud Services Tools (UCS Tools) is a low-code framework for developing cloud-native, real-time, & multimodal AI applications. It features low-code design tools for microservices & applications, as well as a collection of optimized microservices and sample applications. Adopting a Microservices Architecture approach, Unified Cloud Services enables developers to combine microservices into cloud-native applications or services, meeting the real-time requirements of interactive AI use cases.

Each microservice has a bounded domain context (Vision AI, Conversational AI, Animation AI & Rendering, Data Analytics, etc.) and can be independently deployed, managed, & scaled within the application. The abstraction of each domain from the application reduces the need for low-level domain and platform knowledge. With UCS Tools, developers can create complex AI applications in days rather than weeks and months. Moreover, application execution can be distributed on multiple devices and across the cloud to edge and embedded platforms.

Finally, a complete set of specifications and design guidelines will allow domain experts to create microservices using UCS-compatible NVIDIA SDKs.
